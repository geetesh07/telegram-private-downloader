## Overview
This script will allow you to download Files from a restricted / private telegram channel, it also allows multiple downloads at one time and u can specify the file name and path before download (Good for external hard disk downloads)

As of now i made it just for myself to download something i wanted, but i am more than happy to share this to you all. I hope u all download all the legal and the stuff you own from this script :-)

### What are user scripts?
User scripts put you in control of your  browsing experience. Once installed, they automatically make the sites you visit better by adding features, making them easier to use, or taking out the annoying bits. The user scripts on Greasy Fork were written by other users and posted to share with the world. They're free to install and easy to use.

## Installation
1. install a user script manager

    To use user scripts you need to first install a user script manager. Which user script manager you can use depends on which browser you use.

    - Chrome: [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or [Violentmonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violent-monkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag)

2. I dont have this on greasyfork yet, so you will have to install it in the script manager yourself (GOOGLE IT DONT ASK ME COMEON)
  Just copy and paste everything in the scriptmanager and turn it on, i have tested this on  https://web.telegram.org/k/ & https://web.telegram.org/a/ prefer /k/ So if it doesnt work anywhere else please dont ask me i cant really help u, just use /k/

3. ### Check Downloading Progress
A progress bar will show on the bottom-right of the screen for videos. You can also check [DevTools console](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/) for logs.
